# Baseball Performance Widget

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and instructions necessary to run the Baseball Performance Widget, a prescriptive analytics tool developed for coaches in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB). The tool allows users to filter, view, and print key batting, pitching, and fielding statistics using data from the Pointstreak API.

## Repository Structure
.
├── widget.py               # Main Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt        # List of required Python packages
├── WidgetHeader.png        # Header image used in PDF reports (optional)
├── README                  # Documentation and usage instructions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gderomanag/baseball-general-statistics-widget.git
cd baseball-general-statistics-widget
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App
To start the app locally:
```
streamlit run app.py

The Deployment Link is the following:
https://baseball-general-statistics-widget-alpb.streamlit.app/

```

Once running, your browser will open a local URL like http://localhost:8501/ where you can interact with the app.

## Key Features
- Filterable Player Stats: Select player, team, and sort by key statistics for batting, fielding, and pitching.
- Printable PDF Reports: Generate professional, print-ready reports based on filtered data.
- Real-Time API Integration: Pulls current player stats from the ALPB's Pointstreak system.

## Configuration Note
IMPORTANT: The tool fetches data using a season-specific SEASON_ID from the Pointstreak API.

When the season changes, you must update this line in app.py:
```
SEASON_ID = 34052  # Replace this with the new season ID for future data VERY IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUITY
```

## Requirements for Reproduction
To replicate the results or run the tool on another machine:
1. Use Python 3.9 or newer (required for zoneinfo timezone support).
2. Install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
3. Replace the SEASON_ID with the appropriate one for your league/season.
4. (Optional) Customize the WidgetHeader.png if you want a branded header in your PDF reports.
